      <PageTitle>Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?</PageTitle>
      <Text>
        The question is old, traceable to <strong>Leibniz</strong>:{' '}
        <em>why is there something rather than nothing?</em> It sounds obvious
        until you realize it isn’t. There could have been nothing—no world, no
        objects, no consciousness. So why are we here at all?

      <Title order={2}>The Simulation Thought Experiment</Title>
      <Text>
        Imagine a supercomputer running a simulated world. Inside it, there’s a
        conscious person who feels and thinks. What happens if we power the
        machine off? From our perspective, that world disappears. If we resume a
        week later, for the simulated person only an instant has passed— nothing
        strange occurred.

        Push it further: instead of transistors, perform the computation with
        vacuum tubes—or with pencil and paper. Step by step we write the
        operations, and the final output reads: “I am happy.” Now comes the
        punchline: where is the consciousness that says “I am happy”? In the
        electricity? In the vacuum tubes? In the graphite on the page? If I
        close the notebook, does that consciousness “turn off”? Our intuition
        says yes… but something about that answer grates.

      <Title order={2}>The Intuition That Misleads Us</Title>
      <Text>
        The person’s consciousness doesn’t depend on us <em>executing</em> the
        simulation on a physical substrate. What truly exists is the{' '}
        <strong>logical system</strong> that specifies that world. The computer
        or the notebook don’t create the world; they just give us a way to{' '}
        <em>represent</em> it.

        Think of a mathematical function. A straight line exists even if nobody
        draws it. We can plot it, calculate it, or forget it for centuries; the
        function remains what it is—a consistent logical structure that doesn’t
        depend on paper, silicon, or attention.

      <Title order={2}>Worlds as Logical Structures</Title>
      <Text>
        If that’s right, the simulated person’s world is like the line: a{' '}
        <strong>logical structure</strong>. And like any consistent logical
        structure, it exists by the simple fact of being possible. It doesn’t
        need transistors, ink, or a human mind to imagine it. It only needs
        <em>no internal contradiction</em>.

        Our intuition stumbles because we reserve “to exist” for what we can
        touch and see. But that’s only the point of view <em>from inside</em> a
        world. From inside ours, “concrete” means stone, tree, table. From
        outside—if there were an outside—our world isn’t more “real” than a
        number. It’s just another logical structure.

      <Title order={2}>Everything That Can Exist, Exists</Title>
      <Text>
        So Leibniz’s question gets a surprisingly simple answer: there is
        something rather than nothing because{' '}
        <strong>everything that can exist, exists</strong>. Logical possibility{' '}
        <em>is</em> real existence. The line between “possible” and “real”
        evaporates.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        That implies an infinite ocean of worlds, consciousnesses, and distinct
        experiences. That shouldn’t shock us: if there are infinitely many
        rooms, it’s no mystery that I’m in one of them and not another.
        “Inhabiting” a world just means being part of that world’s description,
        nothing more.

      <Title order={2}>Conclusion</Title>
      <Text>
        The mistake is thinking the material is primary and the abstract is
        derivative. I claim the opposite: the logical is primary, and what we
        call “material” is simply the <em>inside view</em> of a logical system.

        That’s why the question resolves so bluntly: no creator, no external
        cause, no further principle is required. There is something rather than
        nothing because <strong>being needs no permission</strong>. Everything
        that can exist, exists.
