      <Title order={2}>Thought Experiment</Title>
      <Text>
        Imagine the following: a perfect simulation of a world is running on a
        supercomputer. Inside that world lives a person. Not a game character,
        but someone who feels, thinks, and remembers. To him, his reality is as
        solid as ours.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Now we shut the machine off. From the outside, our immediate intuition
        is clear: this person disappears with the loss of power; his world
        dissolves into nothing. His consciousness seems to hang by an electrical
        thread.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        But what if, a week later, we turn the computer back on and resume the
        simulation from the exact same state? For that person, nothing happened.
        No waiting, no pause. His life continued as if it had been an instant.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This small thought experiment leaves us with the following intuition:
        the reality of a simulated world appears to depend on the electrical
        impulses of the machine that runs it.
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>Intuition Bomb</Title>
      <Text>
        So far, intuition does not seem problematic. The simulation lives on the
        computer and dies when the computer is turned off. But let's think a bit
        further.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Suppose the same simulation isn't run on a digital processor, but with
        pen and paper. A patient and obsessive person performs every step
        manually, following the program's rules. Every calculation the computer
        would perform in nanoseconds is written carefully in a notebook. And at
        the end, after an impossible amount of hours, the result appears: the
        output of the simulation. Say the notebook reads <em>"happy"</em>,
        because in that moment the simulated person was happy.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        So where is the consciousness in this case? There are no transistors or
        electrical signals. Just a notebook filled with pencil marks. Is the
        consciousness inside the paper? In the pencil graphite? Does it shut off
        when we close the notebook? Doesn't all of this feel absurd?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The same would apply if we use vacuum tubes, an abacus, or even a group
        of people manually executing each algorithmic step. The “simulated
        person” doesn't depend on the specific technology we use to represent
        it. The simulation can always be transferred to another medium.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        And that’s when the intuition breaks: perhaps the consciousness of that
        being doesn't depend on any machine at all. Maybe the computer (or
        notebook, or abacus) is simply a tool for us to represent the state of a
        another world at a specific moment.
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>A Mathematical Analogy</Title>
      <Text>
        To ground this intuition, let’s consider something simpler: a
        mathematical function.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Take the most trivial function you can think of, for example:{' '}
        <Code>y = x + 1</Code>. You can plot it on a computer, or calculate its
        values by hand:
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If <Code>x = 0</Code>, then <Code>y = 1</Code>. <br />
        If <Code>x = 1</Code>, then <Code>y = 2</Code>. <br />
        If <Code>x = 2</Code>, then <Code>y = 3</Code>. <br />
        And so on, forever.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Now, does this function only exist while someone is graphing or
        calculating it? Does it vanish the moment we turn off the computer or
        close the notebook? Obviously not. No one would say that the straight
        line defined by <Code>y = x + 1</Code> ceases to exist just because
        we’re not looking at it.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The common intuition is that mathematical functions “are there”,
        independent of our representations. When we draw them on paper or on a
        screen, we’re not creating them, we’re observing a piece of something
        that already exists.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Mathematical analysis, in this sense, is like opening a window. We don’t
        manufacture functions, we investigate them.
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>Every Simulated World Is Just a Complex Function</Title>
      <Text>
        If we easily accept that a simple function like <Code>y = x + 1</Code>{' '}
        exists (at least in some abstract sense) beyond our representation of
        it, why not apply the same logic to more complex systems?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        A simulated world is, in essence, just a highly intricate function: a
        set of rules that determine how one state evolves into the next.
        Mathematically, there is no difference in kind between the line{' '}
        <Code>y = x + 1</Code> and an entire universe with stars, oceans, and
        conscious beings. The only difference is complexity.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Just as a linear function exists even if no one draws it, a simulated
        world exists even if no one runs it. When we turn on the machine, we
        don’t create the world. We simply generate a representation of it. A
        window. The world itself does not live or die with the hardware.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        And if this holds true for simulated worlds... why not for our own?
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>Infinite Worlds</Title>
      <Text>
        If a simulated world doesn’t stop existing when we shut down the
        machine, but instead exists by virtue of its logical soundness, a huge
        consequence follows: there isn’t just one possible world. There are
        many. Probably infinitely many.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Because if the rule is that every logically consistent system “is
        something,” then there’s no reason to stop at this universe. All other
        describable, non-contradictory worlds also exist.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This, of course, is counterintuitive. We’re used to thinking of{' '}
        <em>this</em> world as the only real one, and everything else as
        fiction. Possibilities that “could have been,” but weren’t. But from
        this perspective, those possibilities aren’t floating in some
        hypothetical limbo: they exist too. Not as imagined futures or potential
        outcomes, but as fully real worlds, just like ours.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If that’s the case, then the multiplicity of worlds isn’t some
        imaginative excess. It’s the natural outcome of logic. Any attempt to
        say “only some worlds exist, not all” would be arbitrary. A
        human-centered intuition, not a universal rule.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The universe we inhabit isn’t <em>the</em> real one. It’s just{' '}
        <em>our</em> real one. We experience it as unique, like a room feels
        unique to the person inside it. But that doesn’t mean the other rooms
        don’t exist. They’re simply separate, inaccessible, self-contained.
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>Concrete and Abstract Are Just Perspectives</Title>
      <Text>
        At this point, a central question arises: if infinite worlds exist, what
        makes our world feel different? Why does it feel so concrete, while the
        others seem merely abstract?
      </Text>
      <Text>The simplest answer is: we confuse perspective with essence.</Text>
      <Text>
        From our point of view, this world is physical, immediate, solid. We can
        touch it, measure it, bump into it. The other worlds, being out of
        reach, we call “abstract”.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        But let’s flip the perspective. Imagine again the simulated being. For
        him, his world is physical and concrete. His objects have weight,
        texture, color. His sky is as real to him as ours is to us. Our
        universe, the one containing the computer or the notebook, would be
        totally inaccessible to him. From his point of view, <em>we</em> are the
        abstract ones.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This reveals something important: <strong>abstract</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>concrete</strong> aren’t two different ways of being. They only
        refer to the perspective of the observer. What is concrete to someone
        inside a system appears abstract to someone outside of it and vice
        versa.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        In this light, “physical existence” just means being inside a system.
        But ultimately, every world, ours included, shares the same ontological
        status: a consistent logical structure.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Even our supposedly “solid” universe is no less abstract than a
        mathematical function. The concrete is a point of view. The abstract is
        another. Both are just aspects of the same thing.
      </Text>

      <Title order={2}>Where Are These Other Worlds?</Title>
      <Text>
        When we hear that infinite worlds exist, our first impulse is to imagine
        some enormous space containing them all, like bubbles floating in a
        cosmic sea. But that image is misleading. It comes from our physical
        intuition: in <em>this</em> world, things exist in space and relate to
        each other within it.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Other worlds are not “in” any place, because space itself is an internal
        property of each world. Our universe has its own spacetime, with its
        dimensions and laws. Another possible universe might have its own, with
        entirely different rules. But there is no shared space that holds them
        all together.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        That means these worlds can’t collide or overlap. They are logically
        coexistent, but not spatially related. No proximity, no distance. Just
        independence.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Think of all the fictional stories that have ever been told. Each story
        contains its own narrative, its own setting, its own internal laws. From
        inside the story, characters have no way of stepping into another story.
        Not because someone prevents it, but because “being beside another
        story” doesn’t even make sense within the story.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The same applies to worlds: each is complete in itself, self-contained
        under its own rules. And our universe is just one more story in that
        great set of stories.

        Conclusion: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        We finally arrive at Leibniz’s question:{' '}
        <em>Why is there something rather than nothing?</em>
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The traditional answer seeks a first cause: a creator God, a prime
        mover, a necessary being that explains the leap from emptiness to
        existence. But that leap is only a problem if we think of existence as
        something rare. Something that needs special permission to happen.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        What we’ve seen throughout this exploration points in the opposite
        direction. There’s no need to explain why <em>something</em> exists
        instead of <em>nothing</em>. The real question is: how could there
        possibly be <em>nothing</em>?
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Because everything that <em>can</em> exist, <em>does</em> exist. Mere
        logical possibility is already a kind of being. A function as simple as{' '}
        <Code>y = x + 1</Code> doesn't need to be drawn to be real. And a
        complex world, with galaxies and consciousness, doesn't need to be
        executed on a processor to be real either. Its consistency is enough.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Existence isn’t a privilege reserved for <em>this</em> universe. It’s
        the general condition of anything that is logically possible. And
        “nothing”, if even possible, would only be one of the possible worlds.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        From inside a world, we call “concrete” what we can touch and measure.
        From outside, that same world looks abstract. But ultimately, those
        differences are just a matter of angle. Ontologically, our world and any
        other share the same status.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        That’s why we’re here. Not because a god decreed it. Not because a
        cosmic dice roll broke the silence. We’re here because there was no
        alternative. <strong>Everything that can be, is.</strong>
