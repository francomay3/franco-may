## Hi! This is the source code for my personal website, [https://www.franco-may.com](https://www.franco-may.com)

The website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework.

## List of technologies used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
- [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction)

## Some Features that I'm proud of

- **Custom Design System** </br> I built a custom design system using [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). This allows me to have a consistent design across the entire website, and ensures that the website is accessible.
- **Custom Blog** </br> I built a custom blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database). This allows me to have a fast and responsive blog, and to easily add new blogposts from within the website, without any need to push to the repository.
