  <p>
    It was a cold February night in Kungsbacka. I was sitting facing the
    fireplace while reading Epictetus, really immersed in the reading. I was
    leaving behind page after page with the margins full of little notes.
    <br />
    I stopped. For whom was I writing these notes? I was probably not going to
    read them again. And there won&apos;t be another future reader of the book
    either (it&apos;s a small book printed and bound by my dad, so I take great
    care of it).
    <br />
    After some thought I came to the conclusion that these notes were intended
    to explain to myself what I had just read. You see, I get lost in thought
    very easily (that was actually what was happening to me at that moment). I
    can read a long time before I realize that I am thinking about something
    else and I do not remember a word of the last 5 pages. That&apos;s why I
    leave my books full notes and marks. I continually force myself to explain
    what I read to prove that I was paying attention.
    <br />
    It&apos;s a strategy that pays off for me, even if I end up reading slower
    than most people.
    <br />
    But What to do with all those notes?
    <br />
    Reflecting on this with Natasha (my wife), it occurred to me to start
    writing a blog in which I can dump the thoughts that pop to my mind not only
    when I read, but pretty much every day.
    <br />
    So that is the reason. I&apos;m going to write about the things I read, of
    course, but I also want to write about anything else that I think about the
    passing of the days.

  <p>
    I am glad you asked! You see, I could have started blogging right away using
    WordPress or some other CMS. But as it is the case with procrastinators like
    myself, I decided to postpone the act of writing and instead build a
    blogging platform from scratch using web technologies. I built this website
    using NextJs, headless components, Firebase, Firestore, Firebase
    Authentication. <br />
    So, let me tell you a bit more about it because I am really excited.
    <br />
    I can log into my website as an admin. When I do, I can create, delete and
    edit blog posts directly from the post page. This is possible because all
    blogs are stored in a firebase database. That way I can also run queries in
    case I want to add a search bar in the future.
    <br />
    All images are stored in a special database as well, so images in blogs are
    also editable. I can select images from a gallery of previously uploaded
    images or upload a new one.
    <br />
    All pages are rendered on the server, so the website is very SEO friendly.
    <br />
    Finally, my github repository is connected to a vercel deployment pipeline,
    so every time I push to master, the website is automatically tested, built
    and deployed.
    <br />
    Everything was made from scratch. This is my baby.
    <br />I will write a longer post in the future to go into the details of my
    choices and the obstacles I faced.

  <p>
    My name is Franco May. I work in Gothenburg, Sweden as a web developer
    specialized in Frontend.
    <br />I moved from Argentina to Sweden {daysSince(
      new Date(2021, 7, 11)
    )}{" "}
    days ago, Men min svenska √§r fortfarande inte s√• bra ü§ì
    <br />
    I have a lot of hobbies, but I usually pay a lot of attention to one for
    some months before skipping to the next one. <br />
    Programming started like this. First I learned python and started creating
    little scripts to do anything that came to my mind. I built a web scraper
    and learned that you can get your IP blocked to enter a website for making
    so many requests. That was cool.
    <br />
    Then I created a plugin for Sketchup using Ruby to subdivide and smooth
    geometries. That was mind bending.
    <br />
    Finally I got interested in web programming. I learned PHP , SQL, HTML, CSS{" "}
    and my beloved JavaScript, which I now use for almost everything.
